# 🌤️ Weather App — My First Python Project

Welcome to my very first Python project — a simple **Weather App** built with `PyQt5`, `requests`, and `python-dotenv`.  
This is also my **first GitHub repository**, created as a learning journey to explore the Python ecosystem and software development practices.

---

## 🚀 About the Project

This is a desktop GUI application that allows users to enter a city name and fetch current weather information using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. It displays:

- 🌡️ Temperature (in Fahrenheit)
- 🌦️ Weather condition emoji
- 📄 Description (like "clear sky", "light rain", etc.)

The goal is to learn and apply:
- Python programming basics
- GUI programming with PyQt5
- Using APIs
- Keeping secrets secure using `.env` and `python-dotenv`
- Git and GitHub workflows

## 📦 Technologies Used

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) — for the graphical interface
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) — for API calls
- [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) — to handle API keys securely
